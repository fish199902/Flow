Flow is a liquid based video game using Ogre and Bullet. It will make use of Bullet SoftBody support in place of fluid simulation to allow real-time play.

INCLUDED:
-BtOgre (http://github.com/nikki93/btogre)
-Advanced Ogre Framework (http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/Advanced_Ogre_Framework)
-TinyXML (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/)
-New DotScene Loader (http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/New_DotScene_Loader)

PREREQUISITES:
-Bullet 2.74 (Other versions may work)
-Ogre 1.6.3 (Others versions may work)
-Code::Blocks (SCons support may be added in the future)

BUILDING:
At the time of writing, the Code:Blocks project is not very portable: Before you build, you will need to update the include paths to match your system. After you have done this, Flow should build. The Code::Blocks project has Linux and Windows targets configured, but others should work (wherever Ogre3D and Bullet are available).
